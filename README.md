# Cincinnati_Traffic_Crashes_Analysis_R

## Inroduction
### This is an analysis on the Cincinnati traffic crash scene, using date from the Ohio governement website. The dataset is called "Cincinnati Traffic Crash Reports." Each row represents a unique car crash incident in Cincinnati, Ohio. There are 326,752 rows/observations in this data set. For this analysis, I came up with two different questions and used R to find answers and create visualizations.

## Question 1 
### What is the distribution of level 1 severity car crashes in Cincinnati?
#### I chose this question because I was interested to see if there were certain roads that were more dangerous than others in the Cincinnati area. The results of this plot show that most of the fatal car crashes occur in Downtown Cincinnati, specifically on the roads East Central Parkway and East 5th and 6th Street. There are also record of some new Riverbend concert venue and Ault Park in Mt. Lookout.

## Question 2 
### Which day of the week has experienced the most crashes when the light condition was considered dark?
#### I chose this question because I was interested to see if there were certain days of the week that experience more car crashes at night than others. The results of this plot show that the majority of nighttime car accidents happen over the weekend on Saturdays, Sundays, and Fridays, respecitvely. They also mostly occur on lighted roadways.
